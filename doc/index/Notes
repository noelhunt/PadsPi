no caps in terms files - diction can locate - maybe write sed script
since it has line number of match
.Tm words puts out pg# +words on stdout

to get terms:
	gettop file
	gethd file
	getital/getcw/getul >file.dist
	getdist BI >>file dist
	maybe sed -f tools/fontch.sed (gets \\f.*\\f) constructs)
	sort file.top file.hd file.dist|uniq >file.terms

terms of form
	words or words \t[sg] where s=specific - just entry under `name'
		g=general - just entry in general, not under name
		no \t entry in both places

to get index:
runind	tr A-Z a-z <file.terms|sort|uniq|awk -f tools/dups.awk >file.lterms
	diction -n -f file.lterms -l -o file.hits file.ms >/dev/null
	doinsert base >base.ms

	prefer ... base.ms 2>file.x
	mkindex file.x

solutions - awk prog to make sure not inserting term in .TS or .PS
tr $ to ~ in hits & back again in mkindex

remaining editing - index has lost caps, font changes and plurals

bugs - .Tm before title is lost
	.Tm containing troff \stuff is converted - shouldn't be
