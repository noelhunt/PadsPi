If you put

\index{some stuff}

in /usr/vol2/latex/latex.tex, between any two lines after
the \begin{document} line and before the \end{document}
line (and also not between any pair of \begin{eg} and
\end{eg}, since those lines are printed verbatim), then
after doing a mk in that directory you will have a
file 'latex.idx' containing lines like

some stuff<tab>249

Unfortunately, the <tab> is literally those 5 characters,
so you will have to

	sed 's/<tab>/	/' < latex.idx

to get what you really want.
TeX just won't let tabs get into it or out of it.
