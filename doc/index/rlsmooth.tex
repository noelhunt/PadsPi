\figurecaption{\rlsmooth}{The running-line fit computes linear fits locally in the symmetric nearest neighbourhoods. The fitted value is the point on the line at the target point of the neighbourhood. Typically in the interior the target point is close to the neighbourhood mean, so the running-line behaves like a running mean. On the boundaries the neighbourhoods become asymmetric and the slope corrects the first-order bias of the running mean.
