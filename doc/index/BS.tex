\figurecaption{\BS}{Piecewise cubic fits to some simulated data. The order of continuity increases from 0 --- discontinuous as in figure (a), to 3 --- continuous second derivatives as in figure (d).
The fitted values are connected within each region, leaving gaps at the knots to make the orders of continuity more visible.
The vertical lines indicate the location of the two knots.
