\figurecaption{\loessm}{The loess smoother first computes the $\lambda$~\% nearest-neighbours to the target point, indicated here by the shaded region. 
A tricube kernel, centered at the target point, becomes zero exactly at the furthest neighbour. The smooth at the target point is the fitted value from the locally-weighted linear fit.}*
