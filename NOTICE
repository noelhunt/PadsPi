# PadsPi
A version of Tom Cargill's 'process inspector' which can read dwarf symbol tables.

'Pi' originally appeared in Eighth Edition Unix, around 1985. This version was
designed to read COFF object files and extract stabs information for debugging.
Pi has a graphical interface which is provided by 'pads'. The original pads was
built against the Blit/Jerq graphics model, and the version I have developed uses
the very similar model available in the Plan9 graphics libraries available in Russ
Cox's Plan9port.

I have used the extremely elegant dwarf-parsing code written by Russ Cox and
possibly also Rob Pike. It is far superior to the commonly used 'libdwarf' library.
Some modifications were made to the code because 'pi' is written in C++, but these
might seem gratuitous to those authors.

In around 2002, Dave Kapilow released a CD containing much later versions of pads
and pi, which appear to have been his own work. Dave Kapilow was at Bell Laboratories
when Tom Cargill was, and I think he kept up the development of pi after Tom Cargill
left. Of particular use to me was his version of pi that was built for Sunos 5.1,
using stabs for the symbol table, and /proc for debugging running processes. The
/proc interface has not changed remarkably from Sunos 5.1 to Sunos 5.11, so that
the version offered here uses /proc.

I have no idea what /proc is like in Linux, but I don't imagine it is so far
different that the code couldn't be ported to Linux with little effort. And since
Dwarf is presumably Dwarf everywhere, that code should also work as it is.
